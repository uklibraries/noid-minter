noid-minter
===========

This is an Archival Resource Key (ARK) minter. It is based on John A. Kunze's NOID
software and preserves its use of the `rand48` pseudo-random number generator. This
allows minter databases which were initiated with NOID to be migrated to `noid-minter`
without risk of random identifier repetition.

This code is just a snapshot! It is still in development.
